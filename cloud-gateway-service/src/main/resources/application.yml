# Registered student-service and subject-service on port 8080. 
# Route is the basic building block of the gateway. It consists of ID, destination URI and Collection of @predicates and a collection of @filters
# A Route is matched if the aggregateâ€™s predicate is true.
# Predicate: It is similar to Java 8 Function Predicate. Using this functionality we can match HTTP request, such as headers , url, cookies or parameters.
# Filter: These are instances of Spring Framework GatewayFilter. Using this we can modify the request or response as per the requirement.
